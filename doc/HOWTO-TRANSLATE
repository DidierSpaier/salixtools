=== USING POEDIT ===

The easiest way to localize any of the tools included in salixtools is
to install poedit from the repositories.

If there is already a .po file for your language and you just want to
update/correct it, you can open the .po file directly with poedit.

If a .po file for your language doesn't exist yet, you can create one
easily with poedit, just select "New catalog from .POT file" from the
file menu, add your details and start translating!

Remember to save the .po file you created like this:

	toolname-langcode.po

EXAMPLE: keyboardsetup-de.po (for German)

=== WITHOUT POEDIT ===

If there is no .po file for your language yet, you can create one from
the .pot file with a command like this:

	msginit -i name_of_shell_script.pot -o name_of_shell_script-name_of_locale.po
	
EXAMPLE: msginit -i keyboardsetup.pot -o keyboardsetup-fr.po

When you create a .po file, or if one is already there, you can start
editing it directly. Looking into the file is self explanatory, using
a text editor of his choice each translator translate the strings in
his language po file.

Example...

	Before:
	
	#: keyboardsetup:93 keyboardsetup:103
	#, sh-format
	msgid "Keyboard configuration"
	msgstr ""
		
	After:
	
	#: keyboardsetup:93 keyboardsetup:103
	#, sh-format
	msgid "Keyboard configuration"
	msgstr "Configuration du clavier"
		
		
=== TESTING YOUR TRANSLATIONS ===

If you want to test your translation, you need to create .mo file from
the .po file, like this:

	msgfmt name_of_shell_script-name_of_locale.po -o name_of_shell_script.mo

EXAMPLE: msgfmt keyboardsetup-fr.po -o keyboardsetup.mo

The .mo filename should be exactly the same as the tool you are
translating.

You can then place the mo file you generated into its appropriate locale directory:

	/usr/share/locale/name_of_locale/LC_MESSAGES/
	
EXAMPLE: /usr/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/

=== SENDING YOUR TRANSLATIONS ===

You can send your .po files to the salix-main mailing list and they will
be included in future versions of salixtools. Just send an email to
salix-main@lists.sourceforge.net
attaching your .po files.
